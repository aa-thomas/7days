# Currently the dedicated server's game mechanics allow roaming and feral night hoards to despawn if everyone on the 
# server logs off when the game's time is paused. When players log immediately back # into the server the hoards never 
# respawn. Since the game is named 7 Days  to Die (I know â€“ I know, 7 # days to die from the infection!) it doesn't sit 
# right with me that my circle playing on my server can # # # conveniently despawn hordes and it happen quite often.
# Well not anymore and now fully supported under 14.5! The following script is fully functional however is not in it's 
# final stage. At the present time if all players leave the server # # # checks are made and if someone leaves on a 
# horde night during the evening the game time resets to # # minutes before the event starts respawning the horde! 
# If they log off again, it resets again -punishing!

# The plan is to intergrate this script with another dynamic server backup script that # triggers when players login to
# the server and handoff to this script so they only consume resources while people are using the server, possible create
# a systemd service to monitor, or something else.
